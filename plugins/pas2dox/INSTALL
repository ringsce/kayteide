Pas2dox Version 0.42alpha
--------------------

Compiling from source on Linux
==============================
1. Unpack the archive
# tar xvzf pas2dox-0.42alpha.tar.gz

2. Build the source for a case insensitive scanner, with the following command:
# make

This will perform the follow commands
# flex -i -opas2dox.cpp pas2dox.l
# g++ pas2dox.cpp -o pas2dox

3. If you need to remove the pas2dox.cpp and pas2dox files, type
# make clean

4. When performing an upgrade of source code, I suggest you do the following
# make clean && make

Installing the binaries on Linux
================================
1. Copy the pas2dox binary to /usr/local/bin/pas2dox

# make install

2. If you need to install to another place, use

# make install INSTALL_DIR="/your/location/here"

Compiling from source on Windows
================================
Currently the source is built on Windows, using Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0
You will also need a recent version of Flex. It can be found at
  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm

a. To build pas2dox.exe from command line make sure environment variables are
   set (run vcvars32.bat). Then execute:

> nmake /F pas2dox.mak

b. To build pas2dox.exe from Visual Studio IDE open the file pas2dox.dsp,
   set active configuration to "pas2dox - Win32 Release" then build it up.

If you don't have Flex and don't want to modify the sources you may use
pregenerated pas2dox.cpp for compilation.

Installing the binary on Windows
================================
Simply copy the pas2dox.exe from the Release subdirectory to either
somewhere in your path, or have your Doxyfile point to it.
